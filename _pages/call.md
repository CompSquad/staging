# Call for blogposts

We invite all researchers and practicioners to submit a blogpost discussing work previously published at ICLR, to the ICLR 2023 blogpost track.

The format and process for this blog post track is as follows:

- Write a post on a subject that has been published at ICLR relatively recently, with the constraint that one cannot write a blog post on work that they have a conflict of interest with.
    This implies that one cannot review their own work, or work originating from their institution or company.
    We want to foster productive discussion about *ideas*, and prevent posts that intentionally aim to help or hurt individuals or institutions.

- The posts will be created and published under a unified template (see [the submission instructions]({{ '/submissions/' | relative_url }})
    and hosted under [the "blog"]({{ '/blog/' | relative_url }}) of this website.

- Blogs will be peer-reviewed, double-blind, for quality and novelty of the content: clarity and pedagogy of the exposition, new theoretical or practical insights, reproduction/extension of experiments, etc.
    However, we are slightly relaxing the double-blind constraints by assuming good faith from both submitters and reviewers (see [the submission instructions]({{ '/submissions/' | relative_url }}) for more details).
